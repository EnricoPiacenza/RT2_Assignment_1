.. moduleauthor:: Enrico Piacenza 4878469@studenti.unige.it

This node implements an Actionlib client that sends a goal to the action server
and waits for the goal to be reached. It also asks the user if they want to cancel the goal.

Subscriber: \n
/odom (nav_msgs/Odometry) - The position and velocity of the robot.

Publisher:\n
/PosVel (assignment_2_2023/PositionVelocity) - The position and velocity of the robot.\n
/goal_topic (assignment_2_2023/PlanningGoal) - The goal to reach.
